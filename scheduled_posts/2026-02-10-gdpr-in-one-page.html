        <h1>A calm map of GDPR scope</h1>
        <p class="subhead">
          GDPR is a European privacy law, but it reaches beyond Europe in specific
          situations. Here is the simple, practical version.
        </p>
      </section>

      <article class="post-body">
        <p>
          Think of GDPR scope in three lanes. First, it applies to organizations
          established in the EU, even if the data processing happens elsewhere. If
          you have an office or a stable presence in the EU, GDPR can apply.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, it applies to organizations outside the EU when they offer goods
          or services to people in the EU, or when they monitor behavior in the EU.
          That means a small company in another country can still fall under GDPR
          if it actively serves EU users or tracks their activity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Third, it applies in limited cases where Member State law applies by
          public international law. That scenario is less common for everyday
          startups, but it exists in the text.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          The practical takeaway: if EU people use your product, GDPR may be in
          scope. Treat that as a design constraint, not a late-stage checklist.
        </div>

        <p>
          The benefits of adopting GDPR-friendly habits are not just legal. They
          help you simplify data flows, reduce risk, and build trust. Even if you
          are not strictly in scope today, designing with GDPR in mind keeps your
          options open as you grow.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Know whether you serve or market to EU users.</li>
          <li>Be clear about what data you collect and why.</li>
          <li>Make it easy for people to access or delete their data.</li>
        </ul>
