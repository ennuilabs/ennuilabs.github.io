        <h1>Rights that make privacy real</h1>
        <p class="subhead">
          GDPR gives people a set of rights to understand, control, and move their
          data. These rights turn privacy into something you can actually use.
        </p>

        <p>
          The right of access lets you ask a company what data they have about you
          and why. The right to rectification lets you correct mistakes. The right
          to erasure gives you a way to request deletion when there is no longer a
          valid reason to keep the data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other important rights include data portability (moving your data to
          another service), the right to restrict processing, and the right to
          object to certain processing. Together, these create a set of controls
          that prioritize user agency.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          A good product design includes a clear path for these requests. If the
          route is hidden, the right is effectively blocked.
        </div>

        <p>
          If you are a product team, the best approach is to plan for these rights
          early. It is far easier to fulfill requests when data is organized and
          decisions are documented.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Provide a simple contact or portal for requests.</li>
          <li>Respond within the required timelines.</li>
          <li>Explain decisions in plain language.</li>
        </ul>
