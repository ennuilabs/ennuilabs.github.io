        <h1>Why “lawful basis” is really about clarity</h1>
        <p class="subhead">
          GDPR requires a reason for processing personal data. That reason is
          called a lawful basis. Think of it as the honest answer to “Why are we
          using this data?”
        </p>
      </section>

      <article class="post-body">
        <p>
          There are six lawful bases in GDPR. In practice, most teams focus on
          a few common ones: consent, contract, legal obligation, legitimate
          interests, vital interests, and public task. The trick is to choose the
          one that fits your product and then communicate it consistently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consent is the most visible basis, but it is not always the best. If a
          user needs a service and data processing is required to deliver it, a
          contract basis is often more appropriate. If your processing is required
          by law, legal obligation is clearer than asking for consent.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          A simple test: if a user can’t really say “no” without losing the
          service, consent may not be the right basis.
        </div>

        <p>
          Legitimate interests can be useful, but it requires balancing your needs
          against the user’s rights and expectations. That balancing test should
          be documented and reflected in your product messaging. The goal is to
          reduce surprises for the people whose data you use.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pick a lawful basis per data purpose, not per dataset.</li>
          <li>Explain it in plain language at the moment of collection.</li>
          <li>Keep it consistent with your privacy policy and product behavior.</li>
        </ul>
