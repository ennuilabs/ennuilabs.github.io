        <p class="subhead">
          Many productivity systems focus on schedules and tools. The quiet
          baseline is sleep: consistent, sufficient rest supports attention,
          memory, and decision-making.

          Research on sleep shows that shorter sleep is linked to reduced cognitive
          performance. That shows up as slower reaction time, weaker memory, and
          less reliable judgment. A calm workflow starts with a stable sleep
          schedule rather than heroic late nights.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want a simple habit, keep your wake-up time consistent. That is
          the anchor for circadian rhythm, and it makes it easier to fall asleep
          on time. The goal is not perfection. The goal is predictability.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          Think of sleep as a system input. When the input is reliable, the output
          (focus, clarity, mood) is more reliable too.
        </div>

        <p>
          A gentle approach: stop screen-heavy work 30 minutes before bed, write
          down the next day’s top two tasks, and let your mind off the hook. That
          small ritual reduces the mental load that often keeps people awake.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Keep a consistent wake-up time.</li>
          <li>Protect a short wind-down routine.</li>
          <li>Plan tomorrow’s first task before sleep.</li>
