          GDPR requires certain breaches to be reported to the supervisory
          authority within 72 hours. The key is knowing when the clock starts
          and what information is expected.

          The 72-hour window starts when you become aware of a personal data
          breach. It does not require perfect information on day one. The goal
          is to alert regulators promptly, then follow up as you learn more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not every security incident triggers notification. GDPR focuses on
          breaches that are likely to result in a risk to people’s rights and
          freedoms. That risk assessment should be documented, even if you decide
          no notification is required.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          A calm incident plan helps: identify, contain, assess risk, then
          communicate. The sooner that process starts, the smoother the 72-hour
          window feels.
        </div>

        <p>
          For small teams, the best preparation is a simple template: who is on
          the response team, how to contact your data protection authority, and
          where breach logs are stored. That’s enough to handle most incidents.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Document when you became aware of the breach.</li>
          <li>Record the type of data and likely impact.</li>
          <li>Notify regulators if risk is likely.</li>
        </ul>
