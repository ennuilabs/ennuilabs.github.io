          GDPR expects organizations to keep records of processing activities.
          The good news: the list can be concise and still useful.

        <p>
          Article 30 outlines what a record should include: who you are, what data
          you process, why you process it, who you share it with, and how long you
          keep it. It’s less about paperwork and more about making your data flows
          explicit.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a small team, a spreadsheet is enough. Each row can represent one
          processing purpose. Keep columns for data categories, systems used, and
          retention. If you can explain the purpose and the data in one sentence,
          you are on the right track.
        </p>

          A lightweight logbook turns compliance into clarity. It also makes
          incident response and user requests much easier.
        </div>

        <p>
          If your organization has fewer than 250 employees, GDPR allows some
          exceptions, but the safest path is to keep a minimal record anyway.
          It costs little and reduces future uncertainty.
        </p>

          <li>Clear retention period.</li>
