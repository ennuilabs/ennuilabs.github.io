          Research on attention shows that interruptions can be frequent and that
          recovery takes time. A notification budget helps you decide which alerts
          are worth the cost.

        <p>
          A notification budget is simply a limit on what can interrupt you during
          a focused day. The idea is not to turn everything off. It is to choose
          the smallest set of alerts that truly matter and let the rest wait.
        </p>

        <p>
          Start by listing all your sources of interruptions: messaging apps,
          emails, calendar pings, social platforms, and system alerts. Then decide
          which ones are “urgent enough to interrupt.” The rest should be batched
          into a few check-in windows.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          A helpful rule: if the message can wait 2 hours without harm, it does
          not need a push notification.
        </div>

        <p>
          For teams, a notification budget creates shared norms. If everyone knows
          when interruptions are acceptable, collaboration becomes calmer and more
          reliable.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Keep real-time alerts for true emergencies only.</li>
          <li>Batch the rest into 2–3 daily check-ins.</li>
          <li>Review your budget monthly and trim aggressively.</li>
        </ul>
