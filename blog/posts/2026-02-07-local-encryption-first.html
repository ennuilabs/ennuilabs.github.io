        <h1>Why AES-GCM guardrails matter for privacy tools</h1>
        <p class="subhead">
          AES-GCM is a fast, modern authenticated encryption mode. It’s also
          unforgiving: misuse can silently break confidentiality or integrity. For
          privacy-focused utilities, the safest path is to design for local
          encryption with strict nonce discipline.
        </p>
      </section>

      <article class="post-body">
        <p>
          Authenticated encryption modes like AES-GCM require a unique nonce for
          each encryption under the same key. The AEAD interface in RFC 5116 is
          explicit: nonces must be distinct for each invocation, unless you are
          using a very specific zero-length nonce approach. In practical product
          design, that means treating nonce generation as a first-class system
          and never reusing it across messages.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          If your app encrypts locally on the device, keep the nonce generation
          local too. Don’t derive nonces from unstable inputs (like timestamps)
          without a robust uniqueness strategy.
        </div>

        <p>
          NIST is currently revising SP 800-38D (the GCM recommendation). The
          announced changes include removing support for authentication tags
          shorter than 96 bits. That’s a signal that short tags are no longer
          considered acceptable for modern usage. For product defaults, stick to
          128-bit tags unless you have a strong, well-reviewed reason to do
          otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
          In privacy tools, local encryption brings a second benefit: it reduces
          your operational exposure. When encryption happens on device, servers
          never see plaintext. But that only helps if your crypto usage is
          disciplined. A minimal checklist we use internally:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Unique nonce per message and per key.</li>
          <li>At least 96-bit tags, with 128-bit as a default.</li>
          <li>Key rotation strategy for long-lived devices.</li>
          <li>Explicit failure handling for authentication errors.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When these guardrails are in place, AES-GCM is a strong fit for
          end-to-end encryption in lightweight tools. The work is less about the
          algorithm and more about operational discipline.
