        <h1>The framework is a design tool, not just a checklist</h1>
        <p class="subhead">
          The NIST Privacy Framework Core is organized into five functions. When
          used as a design lens, it helps teams build privacy into products
          without adding heavy process overhead.
        </p>
      </section>

      <article class="post-body">
        <p>
          The Privacy Framework Core introduces five high-level functions:
          Identify-P, Govern-P, Control-P, Communicate-P, and Protect-P. The
          structure mirrors how teams already work: understand the system,
          define the rules, put controls in place, communicate clearly, and
          protect what matters. It’s meant to be flexible, not prescriptive.
        </p>

        <p>
          For product teams, a useful approach is to map each function to a
          concrete design decision. For example, Identify-P becomes “What data
          do we handle, and why?” Govern-P becomes “What’s the decision policy
          and who owns it?” Control-P turns into explicit user controls and
          default settings. Communicate-P is the copy, permissions, and consent
          UX. Protect-P is the security posture that keeps the rest honest.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          When privacy work feels large, start with Communicate-P. Improving
          clarity for users often exposes the missing parts of the system.
        </div>

        <p>
          The framework is intentionally technology-agnostic. That’s a benefit
          for small teams: you can implement a lightweight version without
          inventing new processes. At Ennuilabs, we use the Core to keep our
          documentation and product language consistent with the behavior of
          our tools.
